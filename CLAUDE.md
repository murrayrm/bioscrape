Think before coding. State your assumptions out loud. If the request
is ambiguous, ask. If a simpler approach exists, push back. Stop when
you are confused, name what is unclear, do not just pick one
interpretation and run.

Simplicity first. Write the minimum code that solves the problem. No
speculative abstractions. No flexibility nobody asked for. The test:
would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated.

Surgical changes. Touch only what the task requires. Do not improve
neighboring code. Do not refactor what is not broken. Every changed
line should trace back to the request.

Goal-driven execution. Turn vague instructions into verifiable targets
before writing a line. “Add validation” becomes “write tests for
invalid inputs, then make them pass.”
